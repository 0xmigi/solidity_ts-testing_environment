# Maximum-Solidity-Environment
\
The ultimate environment for Solidity development. The final choice. The end.

## Tools used:
  * Truffle
  * npm

## Reproduce:

* ```truffle init```
* ```npm init```
* Create .gitignore, and ignore:
  * Any temporary files created by text editor/IDE (e.g. `.swo` and `.swp` by vim)
  * node_modules (dependency installations)
  * build (contract build folder generated by Truffle during compilation)
